# learningriemannianoptimization

This is the code of paper ''Learning to Optimize on Riemannian Manifolds''.

We provide the code for learning to optimize on Stiefel manifolds, and codes for other manifolds will come soon.

1. To train an optimizer, please run 'train.py' in the 'meta_metriclearning_face_2lstm_softmax' folder.

3. To test the trained optimizer, please run 'train.py' in the 'meta_metriclearning_face_ouroptimizer_softmax' folder.

5. The folders 'meta_metriclearning_learnLSTMoptimizer' and 'meta_metriclearning_learnLSTMoptimizer' contain pretrained gmLSTM model.
